# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of cells on a grid based on a set of simple rules. The game is played on an infinite, two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell at any given time step is determined by its current state and the state of its eight neighboring cells.

## Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives (stability).
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Enjoy the game!!!
